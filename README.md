## What You Get From This bolt-control-repo

This is a template [control repository](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/latest/control_repo.html) that has the minimum amount of scaffolding to make it easy to get started with [puppet-bolt](https://www.puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/bolt.html) for serverless catalog deployments.  It's structure is based on the Puppeteers introduction to [serverless puppet with bolt](https://www.puppeteers.net/blog/serverless-puppet-with-control-repo-hiera-roles-and-profiles-and-puppet-bolt/).

The important files and items in this template are as follows:

* Basic example of roles and profiles.
* An example Hiera configuration file and data directory with pre-created common.yaml and nodes directory.
* A site-modules directory for roles, profiles, and any custom modules for your organization.
* An example bolt project configuration, inventory, and plan.

Here's a visual representation of the structure of this repository:

```

├── data/                                 # Hiera data directory.
│   ├── nodes/                            # Node-specific data goes here.
│   ├── common.eyaml                      # Common encrypted data goes here.
│   └── common.yaml                       # Common data goes here.

├── keys/                                 # Eyaml keys go here.
├── modules/                              # This directory contains site-specific modules and is added to $modulepath.
